# Hafiz App â€” What's New

## 1.1.0 (Build 2)

- Performance: Faster startup with a lightweight bootstrap splash while services init in the background.
- State persistence: Pages keep their state (lists remain mounted; scroll positions are restored across navigation and app restarts).
- Offline-friendly: Surah data is cached locally for instant loads and reading without a connection.
- UI improvements: Inline ayah numbers with a refined, theme-aware badge and clear spacing.
- Stability: Updated Kotlin/AGP/Gradle toolchain and fixed connectivity API changes.
- Polish: Resolved analyzer warnings and replaced deprecated APIs for smoother future upgrades.
